# Impact of a block structure on the Lotka-Volterra model
Code associated to the article: "Impact of a block structure on the Lotka-Volterra model", by Maxime Clenet, Fran√ßois Massol, Jamal Najim.

The main section is divided into two folders:
- a Figures folder containing the article's figures with their associated numbers. 
- a Code folder containing the Python code for all the figures in the article.

In the Code folder, the file "base_function,py" contains the majority of the functions used in each other file to create, for example, the interaction matrix per block. Otherwise, each figure has its own code file: the "Figure3.py" file contains the code to create Figure 3 in the article. This file calls "base_function.py" to import the main functions for working with the model.

For any questions, comments or bugs report contact Maxime Clenet.
